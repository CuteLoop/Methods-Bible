  "section_title": "Extreme-, Stationary-, and Saddle-Point Methods",
  "narrative": "This section develops the complex-analytic tools used to extract asymptotic information from integrals with large parameters, especially those arising in Fourier analysis, special functions, and solutions of differential equations. The key idea is that, for highly oscillatory or exponentially weighted integrals, only neighborhoods of a few special points\u2014extrema, stationary points, and complex saddle points of the phase\u2014contribute significantly to the value of the integral. By locating and classifying these points, and then deforming contours in the complex plane to pass through them in favorable directions, we obtain accurate approximations that are often inaccessible to direct calculation. These methods play a central role in applied mathematics: they underlie the stationary phase method in Fourier analysis, the method of steepest descent for Laplace- and Fourier-type integrals, and many classical asymptotic formulas for special functions that solve ODEs and PDEs. In turn, these techniques connect back to contour integration, Cauchy\u2019s theorem, and analytic continuation, and forward to topics such as WKB analysis, dispersion in wave and Schr\u00f6dinger equations, and the long-time behavior of dynamical systems.",

      "title": "A Simple Laplace-Type Integral with a Real Maximum",
      "summary": "Consider an integral of the form \u222b\u2080\u00b9 e^{\u03bb f(x)} g(x) dx, where \u03bb is large and f has a unique nondegenerate maximum at an interior point. Physically, such integrals model contributions from a dominant region in space or time, for instance in statistical mechanics partition functions or in large-deviation estimates. The problem guides the reader to identify the maximum, expand f and g near that point, and justify that the rest of the interval contributes negligibly. The final approximation expresses the integral in terms of local Taylor coefficients of f and g at the maximum.",

The scenario corresponds to a highly oscillatory wave field, where \u03bb is a large frequency or wave number, and \u03c6 encodes travel time or optical path length. Students locate stationary points where \u03c6\u2032(x) = 0, expand \u03c6 and a near such points, and compare the contributions of stationary and nonstationary regions by estimating cancellations due to oscillation.",

Students locate saddle points of f (where f\u2032(z) = 0), sketch level curves of Re f(z), and then deform the contour to pass through a saddle along a path of steepest descent. Along this new contour the integrand decays rapidly away from the saddle, making a local quadratic approximation sufficient to determine the leading asymptotic term.",

By interpreting the phase in the exponent and the amplitude in the integrand, students identify relevant saddle points and determine which ones contribute in different parameter regimes. They then apply steepest descent to obtain a familiar asymptotic expansion, such as the oscillatory large-argument form of J_\u03bd.",
