  "section_title": "Sturm\u2013Liouville (Spectral) Theory",
  "narrative": "This section develops Sturm\u2013Liouville theory, which studies a special class of second-order linear differential operators equipped with boundary conditions. These operators admit real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenfunctions, much like symmetric matrices in linear algebra. The main goal is to understand how such operators arise from physical models, how to systematically find their eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, and how to use these eigenfunctions as building blocks to represent more complicated functions.\n\nSturm\u2013Liouville problems lie at the heart of separation of variables for partial differential equations such as the heat, wave, and Laplace equations. When you separate variables in a PDE, the spatial part almost always becomes a Sturm\u2013Liouville problem, and its spectrum determines the time evolution and qualitative behavior of solutions. This spectral viewpoint connects directly to Fourier series and Fourier transforms: orthogonal eigenfunctions generalize sines and cosines, and expansions in these eigenfunctions allow you to solve boundary value and initial value problems.\n\nConceptually, Sturm\u2013Liouville theory brings together ideas from ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, and functional analysis. It prepares the ground for modern spectral theory of operators, and it links to complex analysis through contour integral representations and analytic properties of eigenfunctions. In applied mathematics, mastering these tools is essential for modeling vibrating systems, diffusion, quantum mechanics, and for understanding how spatial structure shapes dynamical behavior.",

      "summary": "Consider a taut string of length L fixed at both ends, modeled by the one-dimensional wave equation with displacement zero at x = 0 and x = L. Separation of variables leads to a spatial eigenvalue problem in which the eigenfunctions are sine functions and the eigenvalues determine the natural frequencies of vibration. This example shows how a concrete physical system gives rise to a Sturm\u2013Liouville problem on a finite interval.",

Separation of variables produces the same spatial Sturm\u2013Liouville problem as the vibrating string, but now the eigenvalues appear in exponential decay factors rather than oscillations. Solutions with arbitrary initial temperature profiles are expressed as convergent series in the eigenfunctions.",

On the interval [\u22121, 1] with appropriate boundary conditions, the Legendre polynomials emerge as eigenfunctions of a Sturm\u2013Liouville operator with variable coefficients and a nontrivial weight function.

      "summary": "Given a Sturm\u2013Liouville operator with a known sequence of eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenfunctions, one can ask whether every reasonable function on the interval can be expanded in a convergent series of these eigenfunctions. In physical terms, this means whether an arbitrary initial condition can be decomposed into normal modes.
